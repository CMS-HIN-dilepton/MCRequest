# MCRequest
The configuration files for signal generation (embedding, pp efficiency, pp acceptance) for the official MC requests made by the Dilepton group. 

## Important note for pPb
The convention is very confusing. In short all of the following correspond to the same configuration
- proton going to positive eta
- "pPb" in the usual naming convention
- second part of the 2016 8TeV run
- PbP in the vertex smearing option
- no "reverse" in the cfi name
- BetaBoost = +0.434 in the gen filter
